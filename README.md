# Deliverable: Continued use of GitHub

Instructor: Carlos Mejia
Student: Gabriela Sánchez

The main benefits of using GitHub and having a repository are:
1. You can track changes to your code across all versions.
2. It makes it easy to contribute to your projects.
3. Helps create great documentation.
4. You can attract recruiters by showing your work.

This deliverable consists of having one or multiple repositories where code, files, changes, etc. are uploaded. If you continually use GitHub to upload your code, this deliverable is implicit.

The repositories worked on are the following:

1. https://github.com/A01688373/mlops_mod3-1/tree/main
2. https://github.com/A01688373/mlops_mod3-2
3. https://github.com/A01688373/mlops_mod3-3
4. https://github.com/A01688373/mlops_mod3-4
